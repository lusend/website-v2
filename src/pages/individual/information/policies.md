## Billing & Payments

![Filler Header Image](https://liberty-sa.terradotta.com/_customtags/ct_Image.cfm?Image_ID=21487){.header}

### Signature Programs

Students will be billed directly by Liberty University for tuition and housing program costs and the LU Send fee. Students **must** complete Financial Check-In to begin making payments. The cost of all Signature Programs is roughly equivalent to the cost of one residential semester at Liberty University (tuition, room and board).

Students will be required to pay the Signature Program organization and other entities directly for:

- Application Fees
- Commitment Deposit
- Additional Excursions
- Airfare

### Custom Programs

The student’s program provider will invoice LU Send for the total cost of the student’s program. The student will pay their program cost and the LU Send fee by completing Financial Check-In. Students **must** complete Financial Check-In to begin making payments. Students will be required to pay the Custom Program organization and other entities directly for:

- Application Fees
- Deposits (Commitment, Housing, Meal Plan, etc.)
- Additional Excursions
- Airfare

### International Internships

If the student is completing an internship through a Signature or Custom program, then payments will be made as described above, respectively.

If the student is pursuing an independent internship, then the student will be responsible to pay the internship organization directly for all program costs. Please coordinate with the organization regarding payment due dates and other financial obligations. The LU Send fee will still be placed on the student’s account to be paid through Financial Check-In, and students are still required to pay tuition for any corresponding classes (if the internship is being completed for Liberty credit). Students **must** complete Financial Check-In to begin making payments.

NOTE: **Students who have completed Financial Check-In will be prompted to make one full payment; if needed, please contact Student Accounts at [studentaccounts@liberty.edu](mailto:studentaccounts@liberty.edu) to setup a payment plan.**

## Consortium Agreement

![Filler Header Image](https://liberty-sa.terradotta.com/_customtags/ct_Image.cfm?Image_ID=21490){.header}

- A consortium agreement is a document for students taking courses for transfer credit at a host university or study center. The agreement allows students with federal aid, scholarships, and loans to allocate those funds toward their study abroad costs. The consortium agreement is completed in conjunction with the final Course Approval Form. Students will work with the LU Send Financial Aid representative to complete and sign their consortium agreement. The student will upload a copy of the completed form to their LU Send Study Abroad application.
- Students participating in a Custom Program who are not using financial aid do not need to complete a consortium agreement.
- Students participating in a Signature Program do not need to complete a consortium agreement even if they are using outside aid.

Yes. Students are required to have International Health & Travel insurance through Liberty University. When students go abroad they will purchase International Health and Travel insurance with their LU Send Study Abroad fee. Liberty University has mandated that all students that travel through LU Send are required to obtain International Health and Travel insurance.

### How do I purchase International Health and Travel Insurance?

International Internship Students may use Liberty given Scholarships towards their Liberty tuition costs if they are participating in one of the Custom Programs.

### Can I go abroad if I am graduating that semester?

Students are not advised to go on any LU Send Study Abroad programs during their final semester (if possible).

- Transcripts are not received from the host university until 6-8 weeks after completing your Study Abroad program. This could delay the conferring of your degree.
- Study abroad program dates vary and the end date may not be until after Liberty’s Commencement.
- Often times a student’s Degree Completion Plan requirements do not allow students to Study Abroad during their final semester.

\*If you feel that your final semester is the ideal time for you to pursue an opportunity abroad, the possibility can be discussed with your International Education Coordinator on a case by case basis

### How much do Study Abroad trips / International Internships cost?

LU Send Study Abroad programs vary in cost. Price depends on program type, location, program length, in-country cost of living, airfare, etc. For more details on program cost please contact your International Education Coordinator.

### Can I study or intern abroad if I am an online student?

Yes. We encourage online students to participate in Study Abroad/International Internship Programs. Your Peer Advisor and International Education Coordinator will work with you via email and phone to guide you through the Advising and Application Process.

### What countries are not approved by Liberty? How can I find this information?

Liberty receives a list of countries that require approval every three months. Please contact your International Education Coordinator if you have questions concerning a specific country at lusendabroad@liberty.edu.

### Do I pay Liberty or my Program organization?

Students will pay Liberty University for the majority of their Signature or Custom Program cost. Liberty University has a direct bill agreement with all Signature or Custom Programs. Please keep in mind that the students will not pay Liberty for the Signature and Custom Program application fee or housing deposits; these fees are paid directly to the Signature or Custom program.

### When can I complete Financial Check-In?

Financial Check-in is available for you to complete once the Custom Program has sent your invoice to LU Send. Your Coordinator will update your Student Account with the fees for your program abroad. Please note that invoices are generally sent 30-60 days prior to program start dates. If your invoice is received after Financial Check-in deadlines please work with your Coordinator to appeal late check-in fees.

### If I decide to cancel my program before I go, can I receive a refund for money already paid?

Refunds are generally not provided to students for money already paid to the Custom Program and Liberty University. If a student cancels their program prior to the start date they are issued a cancellation invoice from the Custom Program. If a student cancels their program after the LU Send participation fee has been added to their account, they are still responsible for paying this fee. For more information please see the Policies & Guidelines section “Withdrawals & Refunds."

### Is it possible to go abroad for multiple semesters / terms?

Yes, it is possible for students to study/intern abroad for multiple semesters/terms. Students can go abroad consecutive or non-consecutive semesters. Please note any student that Study Abroad cannot take more than half of the credits required for their major or minor at a host university.

### Can family members visit me while I am abroad?

Absolutely! We encourage family members to support students while abroad. This is a great way to share your experiences in a unique way.

### Can I travel outside of my program location while I am abroad?

Yes. Students who travel outside their program location are required to update their itinerary record in their LU Send application portal. There is a list of countries that require pre-approval from LU Send, Risk Management, and LUPD. If you are uncertain of which countries require approval, please contact your International Education Coordinator at [lusendstudyabroad@liberty.edu](mailto:lusendstudyabroad@liberty.edu).
